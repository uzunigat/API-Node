This is an API created with MySQL, Express, React and Node.js.

Frontend: I use webpack with babel configurations in order to build Javascript code with React. There are 2 files on the root (.babelrx and webpack.config.js). Those files seeks to generate Js code from React files who are in app directory.

## Commands:

npm run start: Init server,
npm run dev: Init server for the API (We need to be initialized our databse on SQL. I have a directory "Database" on the root to do it),
npm run webpack: Build Js code for Frontend develop
